#TestMan [WIP]

A micro unit test framework for your C programs

##Usage

Look at the example test suite in the example folder. There is a micro library that have only one function to multiply numbers. The different files are :
    - `example.c` is the code source of the mini library
    - `example.h` is the associated header
    - `example_test.c` is the unit test to test the library
